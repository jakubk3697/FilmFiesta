## Problem to solve
Very often I'd like to watch a movie but I have no specific ideas about genre, actors or year of the film. I was looking for an app where I could answer some out-of-the-box questions, about my mood, some thoughts etc. and be able to easily get movies that would match my answers.

## Idea
I created initial layout on the Miro platform. I would like the application to include
- **RandomQuestions** - you have to answer for few questions and you'll have films matched by your answers. You can check actual questions list in yellow note on Miro table layout. The current idea is that each answer eliminates certain film genres or includes them, and at the end returns the ten most rated films in this categories.
- **Menu with categories** - options to choose categories of films which we want to watch. 
- **Cards including film details** - 
#### Later plans
- **Sign In** - in the future, I'd like to create the ability to create an account and add videos to my own library
- **Video matching** - when the user adds a movie to the library, it will be taken into account the next time the movie is matched after answering the questions
